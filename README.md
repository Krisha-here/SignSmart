## Project Description

SignSmart is a web-based platform that analyzes agreements and contracts before signing.  
It detects risky clauses, explains them in simple language, assigns a risk score, and generates downloadable reports — helping users make informed decisions.

---

## The Problem Statement

Many individuals sign rental agreements, employment contracts, internship offers, and loan documents without fully understanding hidden clauses.

These documents often contain:
- Termination without notice  
- Hidden penalty charges  
- Surveillance consent  
- Liability waivers  
- Restrictive policies  

Later, the response becomes:

> “But you signed it.”

---

## The Solution

SignSmart solves this problem by:

- Allowing users to upload contracts (PDF/Image)  
- Extracting text using OCR and PDF parsing  
- Detecting risky clauses using keyword logic  
- Classifying risk levels (High / Medium / Low)  
- Generating an overall document risk score  
- Providing simple-English explanations  
- Offering a downloadable risk report  
- Assisting users with an AI chatbot for navigation

## System Architecture

User → React Frontend → FastAPI Backend →  
PDF/OCR Processing → Clause Detection Engine → Risk Scoring → Response to Frontend  

The frontend communicates with the backend via REST API.  
The backend processes documents and returns structured risk data.

---

## Application Workflow

1. User logs in  
2. Uploads contract  
3. Backend extracts text  
4. Risk detection algorithm runs  
5. Risk score calculated  
6. Results displayed  
7. User downloads report
